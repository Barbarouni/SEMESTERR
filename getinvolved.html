        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. <br>
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, 
            and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.<br>
            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
