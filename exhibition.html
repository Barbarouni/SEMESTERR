        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, <br>
            ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.<br>
             We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.<br>
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope,
             to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.<br>

        <h2>Evolution</h2>

        <p>
For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. <br>
Where do we come from and how did we get here? 
Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.<br>
Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. <br>
You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <p>
            From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us 
unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. <br>
For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. 
Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
 including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. <br>
Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. <br>
Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. <br>
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. <br> But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
